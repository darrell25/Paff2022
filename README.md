# Paff2022

The analysis code in this repository is a set of R scripts that assume you have taxonomy and OTU tables generated by mothur and the metadata (information about samples as well as SCFA concentrations in the samples) associated with the sequence files deposited to the SRA under BioProject PRJNA900289. The diversity analysis also requires a phylogenetic tree. In this case the tree was generated by FastTree using the representative sequence fasta file output by Mothur.
